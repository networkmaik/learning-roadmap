# First Week in IT: Exploring the World of IT

A week ago, I officially started my journey into the world of IT. Since then, I’ve been immersing myself in various topics by watching videos, reading blogs, and using ChatGPT to answer my questions. IT is a vast field, and I wanted to get a broad overview before narrowing my focus.

## Exploring the World of Network Engineering

After spending hours exploring different areas, I kept coming back to **Networking and Security**. There’s something fascinating about how data flows through networks, how systems communicate, and how security measures protect them. It became clear to me that networking is the backbone of IT—everything else is built on top of it.

The more I learned, the more I realized: this is the field I want to specialize in. So, I started researching the best way to learn networking and quickly discovered that the Cisco CCNA is one of the most recognized and respected certifications in the field.

## Diving into the Basics

Right from the start, I realized that programming is a fundamental skill, no matter which path you take in IT. That’s why I jumped straight into Python and started working on my first script, [Cyber Contacts](https://github.com/networkmaik/cyber-contacts). To get started, I set up VS Code and dove right in, writing my first lines of code. While the project is still a work in progress, it has already helped me grasp the fundamentals of programming, including data types, variables, functions, conditional statements, and loops.

At the same time, I began exploring Linux basics, learning how to navigate the terminal, manage files, and execute essential commands. Additionally, I got hands-on with Git, understanding the importance of version control—an essential skill for anyone working in tech.

## The Next Week

To build a solid foundation, I’ve decided to focus on networking and work towards my CCNA certification. This will provide me with the essential knowledge to understand network infrastructure - a crucial skill for both networking and cybersecurity.

At the same time, I’m continuing to learn Python, as it’s an invaluable skill that enhances automation, troubleshooting, and overall problem-solving in IT.
